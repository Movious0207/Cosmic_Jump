# Cosmic Jump

### Developed by: Jonas Canaza and Lucas Galli

**Cosmic Jump** is an arcade game based on the famous mobile game flappy bird.

You control a spaceship and you have to go through as much asteroid belts as possible, But be careful! the longer you can survive the faster the asteroids will become! 
It also counts with a cooperative multiplayer mode which you can play with a friend using the same computer! if one of you is still standing the other one can come back after hitting an obstacle, so try and get as many points as possible either by yourself or with a friend and enjoy this casual arcade game.
